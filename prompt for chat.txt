Based on your dev console logs, I can see that the Railway integration is actually working perfectly! All four data sources are switching successfully:

âœ… Data â†’ 8,100 transactions loaded
âœ… Data-gp-2025 â†’ 117 records loaded
âœ… Data-gp-2024 â†’ 178 records loaded
âœ… Recap-data â†’ 437 records loaded

However, there are two specific issues that need fixing:
ðŸŽ¯ DIAGNOSTIC PROMPT FOR CURRENT ISSUES
CHIEF PETROLEUM DASHBOARD - CURRENT ISSUE ANALYSIS

Based on the dev console logs, the Railway API integration is working perfectly with all four data sources loading successfully. However, there are two specific issues that need attention:

ISSUE #1: CHART DATA PREPARATION WARNING
- Warning: "No transactions data for trend analysis" in getSalesTrendData function
- Location: database-data-service.js:342 â†’ chart-manager.js:501
- Problem: Chart manager expects 'transactions' data structure but receives different data types (gp-2024, gp-2025, recap)
- Impact: Charts may not display correctly for non-transaction data sources

ISSUE #2: DAILY RECAP DATE SEARCH INEFFICIENCY  
- Problem: System is searching for recent dates (2025-08-15 to 2025-08-04) but finding no daily records
- Behavior: Repeatedly queries same date ranges with 0 results
- Root cause: Transaction data appears to be from older dates, but daily recap searches recent dates
- Impact: Unnecessary API calls and poor user experience

SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:

1. FIX CHART DATA PREPARATION:
   - Update getSalesTrendData() in database-data-service.js to handle different data types
   - Modify chart-manager.js prepareSalesTrendData() to adapt based on data source
   - Add data type detection in chart rendering logic

2. FIX DAILY RECAP DATE LOGIC:
   - Implement smarter date range detection based on actual data availability
   - Add date range analysis to find the most recent data period
   - Optimize daily recap search to avoid repeated failed queries
   - Consider adding "last available date" caching

3. CHART TYPE ADAPTATION:
   - Ensure charts display appropriate visualizations for each data type:
     * Transactions: Sales trends, customer analysis, product distribution
     * GP Data: Goal vs actual performance, rolling averages
     * Recap Data: Driver performance, company analysis, margin trends

CURRENT SUCCESS METRICS:
âœ… Railway API connectivity: 100% working
âœ… Data source switching: 100% working  
âœ… Data loading: All four sources successful
âœ… Record counts: Transactions (8,100), GP-2025 (117), GP-2024 (178), Recap (437)

The core Railway integration is solid - these are optimization and user experience issues.
